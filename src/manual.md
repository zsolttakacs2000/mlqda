## Proposed workflow
1. New users access the home page
2. The user reads the About and/or FAQ pages to get insight into how the system works
3. The user navigates to the Analyser start page
4. The user uploads the correctly formatted text files to the upload field
5. After continuing, the user is presented with their results
6. The user saves their results and leaves the page
7. Upon leaving the page, all data connected to their session is deleted
8. The user has trouble understanding the output, so they check the About and/or FAQ page again.

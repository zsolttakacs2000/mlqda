		<h1>Sentiment Analysis Results</h1>

			Next to the sentences, you can see the sentiment scores.
			These are 'compound' sentiment scores based on negative, neutral and positive
			sentiment scores. They range from -1 to 1. You can also find aggregated sentiment
			scores for your documents and your entire corpora.
		</p>
		
		<p>
			You can check out the FAQ or the About section if you want to know more about the
			process or how to interpret your result.	
		</p>

		<p><strong>
			Please remember to click the Delete Files button after you
			download your results. If you forget to do so, the result file can stay on the server
			for up to one hour before automatic deletion. However, you will not be able to access
			these results again after leaving the page.

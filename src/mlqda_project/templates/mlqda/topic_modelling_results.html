		<h2>Topic Modelling Results</h2>
		<p>The script identified {{ total_topics }} topics in your files.</p>
		
		<p>Ideally these words describe distinct topics in your documents. You will need to deduct
		what these topics are based on the top words. Next to the words, you can also see their contribution
		as a percentage. Within the results, you can see highlighted sentences for each topic. Every
		highlighted pdf shows you the sentences connected to that topic. Thsi way, you can see which sentences
		are connected to the topics.</p>

		<p>Next to the sentences, you can also see the sentiment scores. These are 'compund' sentiemnt scores,
		as they are based on negative, neutral and postive sentiemnt scores. They range from -1 to 1. You can
		also find aggregated sentiemnt scores for each of your document and for your entire corpora.</p>
		
		<p>If you want to know more about the process or how to interpret your result you check out
		 the FAQ or the About section.</p>
